noughts.py
==========

The classic game of noughts and crosses playable in an IRC chatroom and written in Python 2.7

#Usage
Download noughts.py and run:
```
python2.7 noughts.py
```

You will be prompted to pick a server, make sure that server is bot friendly or you will probably get banned. Once the server is chosen the bot will connect and join the channel #noughts.py under the username "noughts". This can all be changed at the top of the python script (below the imports).

To play just join the channel and type in "help" (without the quotes) for the commands you need to play. If the IRC network kicks users for flooding noughts.py could be kicked as drawing the table takes 5 lines.

Different IRC networks have different forms of connecting, so you may need to modify the connection code to get noughts.py to work.

#Demo
Currently there are no known IRC networks with nought.py running. If you know of one or if you are hosting one please pull request this readme or contact me.
